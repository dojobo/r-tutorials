## What are R and RStudio?

![](images/Rlogo.svg){fig-alt="R logo" fig-align="center" width="200"}

**R** is...

-   a tool for data analysis and visualization, especially in statistical and research contexts
-   a programming language[^2]
-   text-based command interface $\rightarrow$ it runs on the console/command line
-   biased towards tabular data and matrices (in practice)
-   free, open-source software (FOSS) stewarded by the nonprofit, Vienna-based R Foundation
-   full name: The R Project for Statistical Computing

[^2]: Programming language style: practical R usage tends to operate in the procedural and functional programming paradigms, rather than an object-oriented paradigm.

![](images/RStudio-Logo.svg){fig-alt="RStudio logo" fig-align="center" width="400"}

**RStudio (Desktop)** is...

-   an "integrated development environment" for analysis and programming in R and Python
-   a graphical layer of software to facilitate our usage of R
-   Posit (until recently, called RStudio) is a Boston-based company, founded 2009, which makes both FOSS and commercial software[^3] and offers hosted services

[^3]: FOSS products: RStudio Desktop, RStudio Server, Shiny Server, and many R packages. Commercial products: RStudio Team, RStudio Workbench.

### What can you do with R and RStudio?

Let's follow the research data life cycle...

![Research Data Lifecycle; source: [Princeton Research Data Service](https://researchdata.princeton.edu/research-lifecycle-guide/research-lifecycle-guide)](images/data-lifecycle.png){fig-alt="A diagram of the research data life cycle. Steps: Plan, Acquire, Process, Analyze, Preserve, Share Results, Discover & Re-Use" fig-align="center" width="500"}

#### Data collection from online sources

-   API == Application Programming Interface
    -   Many open data sources are accessible programmatically via HTTP APIs
    -   You can dynamically query the remote database and get the matching data back in a structured way, as opposed to needing to download many files.

    -   Package: [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/)

#### Data cleaning, processing, and reshaping

For example:

-   standardizing mixed column names, removing extra white space from cells
-   splitting and combining columns
-   detecting and handling missing values and outliers
-   reshaping tabular data

## RStudio Orientation

### Panes

-   Bottom left: Console
    -   Run commands instantly in R $\rightarrow$ see command-line output
    -   Command history (press up arrow key)
-   Top left: Source/Editor
    -   Where you open files (tabbed)
    -   Write a script (multiple lines of R code), which you can *Run* ( = RStudio sends each line of the script to the console pane)
    -   Can also be used to write documents in plain text or markdown, or *notebooks* in RMarkdown
-   Top right: Environment, History
    -   Global Environment = workspace of your current R session
-   Bottom right: Help, Working Directory

### RMarkdown/Quarto

-   This document is written in Quarto format, which is the most recent iteration of RMarkdown. A file written in RMarkdown is also called *an RMarkdown Notebook* or just *an R Notebook*.
-   Extends the popular [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format (seen on Wikipedia and GitHub) by enabling the author to include executable code *chunks* like the one below
-   Switch between Source and Visual editors (buttons near top left of editor pane)

A code chunk:

```{r}

```

### Configuration

-   Tools \> Global Options...
-   Many options can also be configured at project level
-   Keyboard shortcuts are very handy! Tools \> Keyboard Shortcuts Help

### Files and file types

-   [**R Projects**](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects) (.Rproj) are the suggested way of organizing your work in RStudio. Benefits include dedicated [command history](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526217-Command-History-in-the-RStudio-IDE) and settings.
-   **R Notebooks** or RMarkdown documents (.Rmd) intermix R code and text formatted with markdown; the newest version are **Quarto documents** (.qmd)
-   **R scripts** (.R) are plain-text files that can be executed by R directly. However, because the file must be parseable, this means that the only permitted "natural language" is in code comments.

## 📦 Packages: what they are and installing them

In addition to R's built-in functionality ("base R"), we can also leverage work done by the community, released as **packages**. The developer of a package loads it onto a public repository **CRAN** (the Comprehensive R Archive Network). From CRAN, R users can install the package onto their own computer.

Packages are typically built for a specific purpose or to collect a specific set of functions. Here are some popular examples:

-   ggplot2: makes plots (using a "grammar of graphics")
-   dplyr: filters, sorts, and modifies datasets
-   shiny: creates web applications, especially dashboards
-   stringr: has tools to help you work with character strings (text)
-   tmap: creates maps

### To install a package

-   Using your mouse:
    -   in the bottom right pane, click the Packages tab
    -   click the Install button at the top of the pane
    -   type the name of the package you want to install (example: `stringr`)
    -   click Install
-   Running code: `install.packages("stringr")` (replace `stringr` with the name of your desired package)

### To use a package

Once installed, a package needs to be activated before you can use it.

-   Using your mouse:
    -   in the bottom right pane, click the Packages tab
    -   find the name of the package you want to activate (by scrolling or searching in the top-right box), example: `stringr`
    -   click the check-box next to the package name
-   Running code: `library(stringr)`

You will need to reactivate the package every time you start a new R session.

### Let's install and attach (activate) tidyverse

"tidyverse" is a popular collection of packages--and we're about to use it in the next section, so let's install and activate:

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)
```

## Import a spreadsheet as an R data frame

Easiest is the Import Dataset feature in the Environment pane (top right).

The Import Dataset feature generates code, which you can paste into a code chunk, like the one below:

```{r}
tg <- read_excel("data/tumorgrowth.xlsx", 
           sheet = "AnalysisData")

```

This way, the file-loading step will be saved in your document, so that you can easily recreate your session.

## Common data structures in R

### Data frames

A **data frame** is structured in rows ("observations") and columns ("variables"). This can also be called tabular data. Our spreadsheet above is imported as a data frame.

Let's use the `View()` and `str()` functions to examine the data frame:

```{r}
View(tg)

str(tg)
```

You can refer to one variable (column) in a data frame with the **`$`** (dollar sign):

```{r}
tg$Size
```

Data frames are the most typical structure we'll encounter.

### Vectors

On a more basic level than a data frame, a **vector** is R's way to handle multiple items. We create a vector using the `c()` function. For example, suppose I observe the measurements `41.8`, `85.0`, and `114.0`:

```{r}
c(41.8, 85.0, 114.0)

# we can write comments with the pound sign;
# these are ignored by R

# to save a vector as an object:
size <- c(41.8, 85.0, 114.0)
```

Vectors are designed to work efficiently with many repetitive or setwise operations, for example, applying a mathematical operator or function to every item in a vector. We also say these functions/operations are **vectorized**.

```{r}
size * 2
sqrt(size)
```

A limitation of vectors is that every item must be of the same data type (e.g., character or numeric). But they're sort of R's default data structure. They're also the foundation of data frames: each column is actually a vector, which means we'll be working with them a lot.

### Exercise 1

A handy function is `help()`, which queries R's documentation system. Most commonly, you'll look up functions. You can search by running `help(topic)` or `?topic`, e.g., `?sqrt`. Notice that the result will appear in the Help pane.

1.  There is confusion among some R users what the "c" in the function `c()` stands for. Using the help system, what does `c()` do? What do you think "c" stands for?

```{r}

```

2.  Create a vector of arbitrary patient ages and store it as an object called `ages`.

```{r}

```

3.  What do you estimate is the mean age? Calculate it using `mean()`.

```{r}

```

4.  What is the mean value of the `Size` variable in `tg`? How about `numAge` in `cvdr`?

```{r}

```

### Matrices

Vectors are one-dimensional. For 2+ dimensions, we need a **matrix**. We won't use them very much in this course, but they are available for you to investigate further.

```{r}
1:9     # the integer sequence 1 to 9, as a vector

matrix(data = 1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
```

### Lists

Lists are collections of items; unlike vectors, they are potentially heterogeneous. You can also give a name to each item in a list if desired. Many specialized data structures are actually lists with special attributes and functionality.

```{r}
list(sex = c("F", "M"),
     group = c("Control", "1", "2", "3"),
     "cm",
     25:35)
```

### Factors

A **factor** is a vector which represents a categorical variable, i.e., that there are only a finite number of possible values. Examples of categorical variables:

-   type of thing
-   which treatment group (or control group)
-   which observation site (e.g., "Plot A"---but not geographic coordinates)
-   biological sex (although note that \>2 categories may be coded)
-   gender (although note that a binary is not necessarily presumed)
-   month, day of week, week number of year
-   shoe size, athletic weight class (but not: height, weight)
-   Likert scale (e.g., "on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is strongly disaree and 5 is strongly agree...")

The possible values of a factor are its **levels**. Levels may be **ordered** (e.g., month) or unordered (e.g., sex, eye color).

To create a factor, use the `factor()` function. R will automatically determine the levels, but you can specify them, as well as whether they are ordered.

```{r}
factor(c("Control", "Group 1", "Group 2"))
```

Sometimes your dataset might have categorical data coded numerically (e.g., `1` for females and `2` for males), such that you will also want to have a way to store human-readable **labels**.

```{r}
factor(c(1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1),
       levels = c("1", "2", "3"),
       labels = c("Control", "Group 1", "Group 2"))
```

## Objects and functions

When we give R a command, it usually returns an **object** of some kind. We can usually see a representation of this object in the console when R returns the object.

To store the object in memory, in order to view it more than once or modify it, we will need to assign a name to the object. *(Note: saving to memory ≠ saving to disk!)* We'll use the **assignment operator**, written **`<-`**, between our new object's name and the function call. For example:

```{r}
c(41.8, 85.0, 114.0)      # creates a vector with three values

size <- c(41.8, 85.0, 114.0)      # creates the vector and saves it to an object called "size"

# note the "size" object in your Environment tab!
size
```

### Data types

On object's data type determines what kinds of operations we can do on the object. For example, numeric and character vectors have different behaviors:

```{r}
group <- c("Group 1", "Group 2", "Group 1", "Group 1")

size * 2
group * 2   # error!
```

To find out an object's data type, you can see it listed in the Environment tab (`chr`, `num`) or run the `typeof()` function.

### Functions

A function can have one or more **arguments**; for example, the `sqrt()` function takes an `x` argument, which we could also write as `sqrt(x)`. In the code chunk below, we use the `size` object for the `x` argument:

```{r}
sqrt(size)

# R also supports "named arguments":
sqrt(x = size)
```

We say that a function **returns** its output (often an object); `sqrt(16)` returns `4`.

You can also write your own functions, using **`function()`**. Here is a function that raises `x` to the `y` power:

```{r}
my_new_function <- function(x, y) {
  return(x^y)
}

my_new_function(2, 3)     #   == 2^3
```

### An Example Plot

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
data(penguins)
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=body_mass_g, y=bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
  
```

### Exercise 2

1.  Consider:

```{r}
my_seq <- c(1, 2, 3)
my_seq <- c(my_seq, 4, 5)    # predict my_seq's value

my_seq <- c(my_seq, 6, c(7, 8))    # and here?

```

2.  Consider the factor in the code chunk below. Does `bases` have the value you expect? If not: what do you think is going on here?

```{r}
bases <- factor(c("A", "C", "G", "A", "T", "G", "U", "C"), 
                levels=c("A", "C", "G", "T"))

bases
```
