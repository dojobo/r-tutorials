## Notes on presentation format

-   Feel free to follow along on your own computer, or simply watch

    -   This notebook (including code) will be shared!

-   Due to time constraints, this is more of a *guided tour* than a *lesson* in R

    -   Less time for practice/synthesis, but greater number of topics covered

-   

## What is R? What is RStudio?

[**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) is:

-   an application

    -   a statistical analysis and visualization software package
    -   a command-line executable
    -   in version 4.1.2 (12/2021)

-   a programming language

-   multi-platform, free, open-source

[**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/) is:

-   an integrated development environment (IDE) with graphical interface for R and related tools

    -   in version 2021.09 (12/2021)

-   a public benefit corporation that develops software (>50% free and open source) and provides related services

You need R installed in order to use RStudio. They work together, but are separate applications.
