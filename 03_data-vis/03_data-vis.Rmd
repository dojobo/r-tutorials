## ggplot2 and the grammar of graphics

`ggplot2` is the name of an R package. (A *package* in R terms is "the fundamental unit of shareable code." You can read more about them in the [R Packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/intro.html) by Wickham and Bryan.) ggplot2 is probably the most popular R package and is useful to a broad number of R users. ggplot2 is also part of "[the tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)," a collection of packages that all work well together because they use shared data structures, they try to make the same assumptions, etc.

1.  To install ggplot2: run `install.packages("ggplot2")` or, in the bottom right pane, click the Packages tab > Install button at left.
2.  To include ggplot2 in your project: run `library(ggplot2)`.
3.  Alternatively, you can install and use tidyverse: `install.packages("tidyverse")` and `library(tidyverse)`. This will take just a little longer when you first run it, but I think the tidyverse is the best way to use R anyway.

ggplot2 is conceptually based in a "layered grammar of graphics" as described in Hadley 2010:

![](images/hadley2010.png)

Wickham, Hadley. 2010. "A Layered Grammar of Graphics." Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics 19 (1): 3--28. <https://doi.org/10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098.>

### The "code template" for a plot

Minimal:

```{ggplot(data = <DATA>) +}
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```

`<DATA>` is a dataframe or tibble.

Mappings take the format `aesthetic = variable`, e.g., `x = time_elapsed` (the continuous variable `time_elapsed` is on the x axis) or `color = species` (the categorical variable `species` is indicated using different colors).

More:

```{ggplot(data = <DATA>) +}
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>)) +
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>), stat=<STAT>, position=<POSITION>) +
  <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
  <FACET_FUNCTION> +
  <SCALE_FUNCTION> +
  <THEME_FUNCTION>
```

## Example data sets

**`storms`**: "This data is a subset of the NOAA Atlantic hurricane database best track data, <https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/#hurdat.> The data includes the positions and attributes of storms from 1975-2020, measured every six hours during the lifetime of a storm." (See more: `?storms`)

**`diamonds`**: "A dataset containing the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds." (See more: `?diamonds`)

## Exploratory data analysis

### Single variable

Histograms (continuous)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# frequency of latitude observations:
ggplot(data=storms) +
  geom_histogram(mapping=aes(x=lat))

# set binwidth, using same units as data:
ggplot(data=storms) +
  geom_histogram(mapping=aes(x=lat), binwidth=2.0)
ggplot(data=storms) +
  geom_histogram(mapping=aes(x=lat), binwidth=1.0)
ggplot(data=storms) +
  geom_histogram(mapping=aes(x=lat), binwidth=0.5)

ggplot(data=storms) +
  geom_histogram(mapping=aes(x=long))   # longitude

ggplot(data=storms) +
  geom_histogram(mapping=aes(x=wind), binwidth=5)   # wind
```

Bar charts (discrete)

```{r}
# a count of storm observations in each category (i.e., 1-5 Saffir-Simpson scale)
ggplot(data=storms) +
  geom_bar(mapping=aes(x=category))

# beware that ggplot won't save you from unreasonable plotting:
ggplot(storms) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y=name))

# a more reasonable set to visualize, names of 2005 storms:
storms2005 <- storms %>% filter(year==2005)
ggplot(storms2005) + 
  geom_bar(aes(y=name))
```

You try:

1.  How would you plot a histogram of `pressure` from `storms`?
2.  In the `diamonds` dataset, how would you plot the distribution of `price`? Of `carat` (0.2-5.01)?
3.  In `diamonds`, how would you plot the counts (relative distribution) of `cut` (Fair-Ideal)? Of `color` (D, best, to J, worst)?

```{r}

```

### Two variables

Two continuous variables: scatter plots (`geom_point()`), smooth lines (`geom_smooth()`)

```{r}
# scatter plot of wind and pressure of 2005 storms:
ggplot(data=storms2005) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=wind, y=pressure))

# using transparency for overplotting:
ggplot(data=storms2005) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=wind, y=pressure, alpha=0.1))

# 2d binning:
ggplot(data = storms2005) +
  geom_bin2d(mapping=aes(x=wind, y=pressure))
```

One discrete, one continuous: column charts, box/violin plots

```{r}
# box plot of wind for each category:
ggplot(data=storms) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping=aes(x=category, y=wind))

ggplot(storms) +
  geom_violin(aes(x=category, y=wind))

# pressure distribution for each category:
ggplot(storms) +
  geom_violin(aes(x=category, y=pressure))

ggplot(storms) +
  geom_col(aes(x=year,y=wind),stat="mean")
```

### Using a third aesthetic and variable

```{r}
ggplot(data=storms2005) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=wind, y=pressure), alpha=0.1)

ggplot(data=storms2005) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=wind, y=pressure, color=category), alpha=0.3)
```

You try:

1.  In `diamonds`, scatter plot (`geom_point()`) some continuous variables against one other. Any interesting relationships?
2.  What are the distributions of each diamond `cut` like in terms of `price`?

```{r}

```

## Styling your plots for presentation or publication

### Labels and legends

```{r}
ggplot(data=storms2005) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=wind, y=pressure, color=category), alpha=0.3) +
  labs(x = "Max. Sustained Windspeed (knots)",
       y = "Atmospheric Pressure (mB)",
       category = "Saffir-Simpson Scale")
```

### Themes and color palettes

```{r}
ggplot(data=storms2005) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=wind, y=pressure, color=category), alpha=0.3) +
  theme_minimal()
```
