## Agenda

1.  What is meant by "data wrangling?"
2.  Loading data files
3.  The Tidy Data concept
4.  Columns: rename, split, create
5.  Handle missing values
6.  Filtering and summarizing
7.  Reshape data (pivot)

Most of what we are doing today is in the {dplyr} and {tidyr} packages. These PDF cheat sheets are a handy reference: [dplyr](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-transformation.pdf), [tidyr](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/tidyr.pdf)

## About the Presenter

## What is meant by "data wrangling?"

In a *structured* data context, i.e., tabular and/or structured documents, e.g., XML or JSON, includes:

-   getting a file from an external source open and properly loaded

    -   extraction may be needed e.g. from a document format to a tabular format
    -   missing values should be correctly recognized and recorded as `NA` in R objects
    -   data types are always important in R; each imported column should be of the correct type (e.g., `col_integer()`, not `col_character()`, for a `birth_year` column)

-   cleaning

    -   Investigate/correct data entry
    -   Incomplete observations may need to be dropped (if missing completely at random, or not meeting the experimental protocol) or filled with imputed values (e.g., mean)

-   creating new columns which compute their values from an existing column

-   filtering rows to use only relevant data

## Loading data files

Using `{readr}` and `{readxl}` ([cheat sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-import.pdf))

### Tabular data: CSV, TSV, XLSX

While you may be most familiar with Excel files (`.xlsx` filenames) for spreadsheets, plain-text *delimited* files are often the format of choice. CSV (`.csv` filenames), comma-separated values, is the most popular.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| Pros of CSV vs. Excel                                                                       | Cons of CSV vs. Excel                                        |
+=============================================================================================+==============================================================+
| $\bullet$ Open in any tabular data software, or even a text editor; non-proprietary format\ | $\bullet$ No formatting\                                     |
| $\bullet$ Small file size (although there are smaller)\                                     | $\bullet$ No formulas, only their outputs\                   |
| $\bullet$ Long-term preservation standard\                                                  | $\bullet$ No charts/graphics, pivot tables, etc.\            |
| $\bullet$ No formulas or macros; nothing hidden\                                            | $\bullet$ Only one worksheet per file\                       |
| $\bullet$ Less likely to "break" or become corrupted than an Excel file                     | $\bullet$ Excel can be annoying about opening them\          |
|                                                                                             | $\bullet$ Occasionally, issues with improperly generated CSV |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

Comma-separated values:

```{csv}
response_id,date,respondent_id,question_number,response
1,2022-02-01,27,3,"B"
1,2022-02-01,27,4,"C"
```

First row is typically header; comma (or other delimiter) for each column; newline for each row.

Tab-separated values:

```{tsv}
response_id date  respondent_id question_number response
1 2022-02-01  27  3 "B"
1 2022-02-01  27  4 "C"
```

```{r}
# a random sampling of Allegheny County air quality data, downloaded from wprdc.org:
air_quality <- read_csv("data/air-quality2.csv")
air_quality

# important tweaks: header (none and/or supply your own); col_types; na

emissions <- read_tsv("data/sdg_13_10.tsv")
emissions

#excel_sheets("file.xlsx") # list of sheets 
#read_excel()

#read_excel(sheets=c())

```

Other things you can configure in `{readr}` when importing data: provide your own header; skip lines; read a subset of lines; specify decimal marks; select only certain columns for import; read multiple files into a single table.

### Reading Excel files

You can use the `{readxl}` package to read `.xlsx` files. Because there are potentially many parameters, I like to use RStudio's Import Dataset feature for a graphical interface, which generates the code I need. Then I paste that code into my notebook and run it.

```{r}
messy_bp <- read_excel("02_data-wrangling/data/messy_bp.xlsx", 
                       range = "A4:M24")
View(messy_bp)
```

### Looking around

Our messy data today are [messy_bp from the {medicaldata} package](https://github.com/higgi13425/medicaldata#available-messy-datasets-beta). Our clean data are penguins from [{palmerpenguins}](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

Here are some ways to superficially browse/examine a dataset:

```{r}
data(penguins)
# str() is a generic function, to examine the structure of any object
str(messy_bp)
str(penguins)
# glimpse() is a tidyverse variation specific for dataframes
glimpse(messy_bp)
glimpse(penguins)

# calling an object prints some representation of it
messy_bp 
penguins
View(messy_bp)  # Excel-like view (note interactive features)
View(penguins)

head(penguins)  # fetch first 6 rows
tail(messy_bp, n=20)  # fetch last 20 rows

penguins %>% 
  slice_sample(n=20)  # extract ("slice") 20 random rows

# sorting!
# using the dplyr::arrange() function:
penguins %>% 
  arrange(bill_length_mm)  # arrange by bill length, ascending
penguins %>% 
  arrange(desc(body_mass_g))  # body mass descending (heaviest first)
penguins %>% 
  arrange(island, species)  # arrange first by island, then by species

# see a summary of each variable in an object
summary(penguins)

# note that similar to str(), summary() is a generic function which may have different implementation for different types of objects
```

### Other types of data

Here are packages you can check out for other types of data:

-   web APIs: `{httr}`
-   web scraping: `{rvest}`
-   google sheets: `{googlesheets4}`
-   SPSS, Stata, SAS files: `{haven}`
-   databases: `{DBI}`
-   json: `{jsonlite}`
-   XML: `{xml2}`
-   plain text: `readr::read_lines()`
-   geospatial data (e.g., shapefiles): `{sf}, {terra}`

## The Tidy Data concept

![Illustrations from the [Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/) blog [Tidy Data for reproducibility, efficiency, and collaboration](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2020/10/12/tidy-data/) by Julia Lowndes and Allison Horst](images/tidydata_1.jpg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Important syntax sidebar: the pipe, `%>%`

The **pipe** is typed as **`%>%`** or using the (Win) **Ctrl+Shift+M** or (macOS) **Cmd+Shift+M** keyboard shortcut. Provided by `{magrittr}` and used almost everywhere in the tidyverse.

What does it do? `expressionA %>% functionB()` passes the output of `expressionA` as an implicit first argument of `functionB()`:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  select(species, body_mass_g, sex)

# writing the above without a pipe
select(penguins, species, body_mass_g, sex)

# so what? compare once we start chaining (piping) multiple functions:

# sort by body_mass_g (descending) after selecting columns:
penguins %>% 
  select(species, body_mass_g, sex) %>% 
  arrange(desc(body_mass_g))

# doing the same without the pipe:
arrange(select(penguins, species, body_mass_g, sex), desc(body_mass_g))

# ^ increasingly illegible
# another alternative is to write shorter lines of code without nesting, but then you'll have a lot of intermediate objects in your environment.
```

### and what about `<-` for object assignment? Can I use `=` instead?

```{r}
area <- 16 * 4
area
area = 16 * 4
area
```

**Yes, but** `<-` is recommended, because:

1.  It is community convention, which is important when you read others' code
2.  Besides object assignment, `=` in R is also used with *named arguments*; it can be visually helpful to separate these different functionalities with different symbols, `<-` and `=` respectively.

Keyboard shortcuts to type **`<-`**: (Win) **Alt+-** or (macOS) **Option+-**

## Columns: renaming, splitting, creating

Using `{dplyr}` ([cheat sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-transformation.pdf)) and `{tidyr}` ([cheat sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/tidyr.pdf)).

```{r}
stop <- read_excel("data/messy_bp.xlsx", 
    range = "A4:M24")
study_date <- as.Date("2020-10-20")

stop <- stop %>% 
  clean_names() 

stop %>% 
  select(pat_id, year_of_birth, bp_8) # retain only certain columns

stop %>% 
  relocate(sex, .after=pat_id) # move column

stop <- stop %>% 
  rename(v1_bp = bp_8, v2_bp = bp_10, v3_bp = bp_12) # rename column, new_name=old_name

# separate or unite columns:
stop %>% 
  separate(col=bp_8, into=c("v1_sbp", "v1_dbp"), sep="/", convert=TRUE)

stop %>% 
  unite(col="birth_date", year_birth, month_of_birth, day_birth, sep="-")

# mutate (create a new column):
stop %>% 
  mutate(birth_date = 
           make_date(year=year_birth,
                     month=month_of_birth,
                     day=day_birth), 
         .after=pat_id) %>% 
  mutate(age = 
           trunc((birth_date %--% study_date)/years(1)), 
         .after=birth_date) 
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Missing values

Sometimes, missing values are no problem 👍

But sometimes, you might want to:

-   investigate which observations have missing values and verify them
-   drop (delete) incomplete observations
-   or, replace missing values with something else (an imputed value)

```{r}
# drop the rows that have NA in the sex column:
penguins %>% 
  drop_na(sex)

# replace NA with 0
na_diam <- storms %>% 
  filter(is.na(hurricane_force_diameter))
na_diam
na_diam %>% 
  replace_na(list(hurricane_force_diameter=0))

# functions often have to make assumptions about NA
# examine docs for these assumptions, and configurability
mean(storms$hurricane_force_diameter)  # returns NA
# why? (5 + 10 + NA)/3 = NA
?mean
mean(storms$hurricane_force_diameter, na.rm=TRUE) # returns 18.14766
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Match values; regular expressions

### Filter/subset by column contents

```{r}
# Adelie observations:
penguins %>% 
  filter(species=="Adelie")
# name matching a vector of strings:
penguins %>% 
  filter(island %in% c("Biscoe", "Torgersen"))

```

![Artwork by \@allison_horst](images/dplyr_filter.jpg)

### Getting all distinct values in a column

```{r}

# distinct() gives unique values of a variable/column
# all storm names in the set:
storms %>% 
  select(name) %>% 
  distinct(name) %>% 
  arrange(name)
```

### Grouping and summarizing

```{r}
# count how many observations are associated with each species:
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(n())

# summarize body mass values after grouping by species:
penguins %>% 
  drop_na(body_mass_g) %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(n(),
            min(body_mass_g),
            mean(body_mass_g),
            median(body_mass_g),
            max(body_mass_g),
            sd(body_mass_g))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Reshape data (pivot)

When a dataset doesn't have one observation per row and/or one variable per column, we need to **reshape** it using `{tidyr}`.

In `table2`, one column shows `type` (of measurement), either "cases" or "population."

```{r}
View(table2)
```

We can use the information in `type` to make two new columns, `cases` and `population`, which hold the value of `count`. We do this with `pivot_wider()`:

```{r}
table2 %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=type, values_from=count)
```

In contrast, `table4a` has a column for each year; we would like to move year information into its own column, and reduce

```{r}
table4a

table4a %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to="year", values_to="cases")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Save data

Using `{readr}`

```{r}
table3
table3 %>% 
  write_csv("table3.csv")
```

## \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

## Pipes in R

The **pipe** is an operator, written **`%>%`**, that enables us to pass the output from one function, into another function. Consider:

```{r}
my_values <- -1:-10    # -1 to -10, as a vector
my_values

# below i take the absolute value, then the square root, 
# then round to 3 decimal places, then calculate the mean
mean(round(sqrt(abs(my_values)), 3))

# with a pipe, this can be rewritten as:
my_values %>% 
  abs() %>% 
  sqrt() %>% 
  round(3) %>%
  mean()

# more readable, right?
```

The keyboard shortcut for `%>%` is **Ctrl+Shift+M** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+M** (macOS).

You might also see a newer notation for the pipe, `|>`. It works the same way:

```{r}
my_values |>
  abs() |>
  sqrt() |>
  round(3) |>
  mean()
```

We'll be using the first pipe, also called "the magrittr pipe" after the package it comes from.

![magrittr logo](assets/magrittr.png){fig-alt="magrittr logo" fig-align="center"}

## Looking at data frames

`print()`, str()`,`View()`,`summary()\`

```{r}
cvdrisk <- read_csv("data/genoData.csv")
cvdrisk %>% print()
```

Get a histogram of a variable

```{r}
ggplot(cvdrisk, aes(sbp)) + geom_histogram()
```

## Selecting columns; filtering and sorting rows

### `select()`: which columns?

```{r}
cvdrisk
str(cvdrisk)    # 17 variables (columns)

cvdrisk %>% 
  select(numAge, gender, bmi, treat)

# how many columns do we have? how many rows?
# notice that the column order is also different

# you can also select using index numbers:
cvdrisk %>%
  select(3:7)

```

### `filter()`: which rows?

![Artwork by \@allison_horst](assets/dplyr_filter.jpg){fig-alt="Cartoon showing three fuzzy monsters either selecting or crossing out rows of a data table. If the type of animal in the table is “otter” and the site is “bay”, a monster is drawing a purple rectangle around the row. If those conditions are not met, another monster is putting a line through the column indicating it will be excluded. Stylized text reads “dplyr::filter() - keep rows that satisfy your conditions.”" fig-align="center"}

```{r}
cvdrisk %>%
  filter(numAge == 19) %>% 
  select(patientID, numAge, smoking)

cvdrisk %>%
  filter(tchol > 200)

# comparisons: > >= < <= == !=


# check multiple values with the %in% operator, and a vector:
cvdrisk %>%
  filter(race %in% c("Black/AfAm", "AmInd"))
cvdrisk %>% 
  distinct(race)
# BMI is between 25 and 30 (inclusive):
cvdrisk %>%
  filter(between(bmi, 25, 30))
```

Multiple conditions can be combined with the symbols `&` (ampersand, "AND") and `|` (vertical pipe, "OR").

```{r}
cvdrisk %>% 
  filter(between(numAge, 19, 24) & smoking == "Y")

cvdrisk %>% 
  filter(between(numAge, 19, 24) | smoking == "Y")
```

### `arrange()`: in what order should the rows appear?

```{r}
# sort by numAge:
cvdrisk %>% 
  filter(between(bmi, 25, 26)) %>% 
  arrange(numAge)

# sort by numAge, descending (oldest first):
cvdrisk %>% 
  filter(between(bmi, 25, 26)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(numAge))

# sort by multiple columns:
cvdrisk %>% 
  arrange(numAge, desc(bmi))
```

## Exercise 1

1.  Using `filter()`, get patients aged 30+ whose systolic blood pressure is greater than 135. Store this set as an object called `high_bp`.

```{r}
high_bp <- cvdrisk %>% filter(numAge >= 30 & sbp > 135)
```

2.  Sort `high_bp` according to numeric age and systolic blood pressure.

```{r}
high_bp %>% 
  arrange(numAge, sbp) %>% View()
```

3.  Why doesn't the code below work? Can you fix it?

```{r}
#| eval: false

cvdrisk %>% 
  select(age, htn, treat, smoking, race, t2d, gender, bmi) %>% 
  filter(t2d == "Y") %>% 
  arrange(numAge)
```

## `mutate()`: Creating new columns

![Artwork by \@allison_horst](assets/dplyr_mutate.png){fig-alt="Cartoon of cute fuzzy monsters dressed up as different X-men characters, working together to add a new column to an existing data frame. Stylized title text reads “dplyr::mutate - add columns, keep existing.”" fig-align="center"}

Example using the `smartpill` dataset:

```{r}
str(smartpill)
smartpill %>% 
  select(1:6) %>% 
  mutate(BMI = Height / Weight^2)
```

## Grouping and summarizing

Often, our observations can be arranged into interesting *groups*, typically based on a categorical variable (e.g., gender, race, age group, treatment). Our next step is usually to *summarize* those groups: how many observations in each group? What are the median and mean values, standard deviation, etc.?

Available summarizing functions:

-   `n()`, `n_distinct()`
-   `mean()`, `median()`, `sum()`
-   `quantile()`, `min()`, `max()`, `IQR()`, `sd()`, `var()`

```{r}
cvdrisk %>%
  group_by(smoking) %>%
  summarize(n(), mean(numAge), mean(bmi), mean(sbp), mean(tchol))

# pause here for students to try

```

```{r}
# or to apply the same summary function across() columns:
cvdrisk %>%
  group_by(smoking) %>%
  summarize(n(), across(c(numAge, bmi, sbp, tchol), mean))
```

![Artwork by \@allison_horst](assets/dplyr_across.png){fig-alt="A cute round fuzzy monster with fairy wings and a wand, with a party hat on reading “mean”, bouncing across the top of a data table applying the function to each column. Stylized text reads: “dplyr::across() - use within mutate() or summarize() to apply function(s) to a selection of columns!” An example shows the use within summarize: summarize(across(where(is.numeric), mean))."}

## `slice_sample()`: Random sampling of rows

meaning of "slice"

```{r}
cvdrisk %>% 
  slice_sample(prop=0.2)

```

## Data cleaning: tidy data, missing values

When a dataset doesn't have one observation per row and/or one variable per column, we need to **reshape** it using `{tidyr}`.

![Artwork by \@allison_horst](assets/tidydata_1.jpg){fig-alt="Stylized text providing an overview of Tidy Data. The top reads “Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. - Hadley Wickham.” On the left reads “In tidy data: each variable forms a column; each observation forms a row; each cell is a single measurement.” There is an example table on the lower right with columns ‘id’, ‘name’ and ‘color’ with observations for different cats, illustrating tidy data structure."}

In `table2`, one column shows `type` (of measurement), either "cases" or "population."

```{r}
View(table2)
```

We can use the information in `type` to make two new columns, `cases` and `population`, which hold the value of `count`. We do this with `pivot_wider()`:

```{r}
table2 %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=type, values_from=count)
```

In contrast, `table4a` has a column for each year; we would like to move year information into its own column, and reduce the overall number of columns to make the table "longer"---`pivot_longer()`.

```{r}
table4a

table4a %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to="year", values_to="cases")
```

## Exporting data from R

### Saving as CSV (readr)

```{r}
write_csv(high_bp, "high-bp.csv")
```

### Saving as XLSX

```{r}
write_xlsx(high_bp, "high-bp.xlsx")
```

### Saving as RDS and RData

.RDS and .RData are two file formats specific to R.

-   **RDS**, "R data structure" (I think), is for saving an R *object* (e.g., data frame) to disk. This file will be smaller than a CSV or XLSX and faster to load/save in R. This makes it a good choice for saving a dataset you're working on.
-   **RData** is for saving your R *session* (Environment pane) to disk. Upon starting a session, this can be a faster way to restore your workspace than running your entire notebook again.

To save an object as RDS:

```{r}
saveRDS(cvdrisk, "data/cvdrisk.RDS")
```

To load an RDS file into an R object:

```{r}
loaded_cvdrisk <- readRDS("data/cvdrisk.RDS")

# what does this loaded RDS look like?
str(loaded_cvdrisk)
```

To work with .RData files, the easiest way is to use the load/save icons at top left of the Environment pane .

There is also an RStudio save-on-exit feature which preserves your session (as a .RData), so that next time you open RStudio, you can pick up where you left off. This is convenient, but requires diligent notebook accounting.

![Tools \> Global Options... \> General](assets/config-rdata.png){fig-alt="Cropped screenshot of RStudio's global option. The selection is titled Workspace. There is a checkbox labeled \"Restore .RData into workspace at startup\". The box is unchecked. There is a drop-down menu reading \"Save workspace to .RData on exit:\". The option \"Never\" is selected." fig-align="center"}
