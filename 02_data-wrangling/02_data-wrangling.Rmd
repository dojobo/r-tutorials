## What is meant by "data wrangling?"

In a *structured* data context, i.e., tabular and/or structured documents, e.g., XML or JSON, includes:

-   getting a file from an external source open and properly loaded

    -   extraction may be needed e.g. from a document format to a tabular format
    -   missing values should be correctly recognized and recorded as `NA` in R objects
    -   data types are always important in R; each imported column should be of the correct type (e.g., `col_integer()`, not `col_character()`, for a `birth_year` column)

-   cleaning, i.e., correction of detectable errors, standardization of values, discarding incomplete observations

-   creating new columns which compute their values from an existing column

-   filtering rows to use only relevant data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Loading data files

Using `{readr}` and `{readxl}` ([cheat sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-import.pdf))

### Tabular data: CSV, TSV, XLSX

While you may be most familiar with Excel files (`.xlsx` filenames) for spreadsheets, plain-text *delimited* files are often the format of choice. CSV (`.csv` filenames), comma-separated values, is the most popular.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| Pros of CSV vs. Excel                                                                       | Cons of CSV vs. Excel                                        |
+=============================================================================================+==============================================================+
| $\bullet$ Open in any tabular data software, or even a text editor; non-proprietary format\ | $\bullet$ No formatting\                                     |
| $\bullet$ Small file size (although there are smaller)\                                     | $\bullet$ No formulas, only their outputs\                   |
| $\bullet$ Long-term preservation standard\                                                  | $\bullet$ No charts/graphics, pivot tables, etc.\            |
| $\bullet$ No formulas or macros; nothing hidden\                                            | $\bullet$ Only one worksheet per file\                       |
| $\bullet$ Less likely to "break" or become corrupted than an Excel file                     | $\bullet$ Excel can be annoying about opening them\          |
|                                                                                             | $\bullet$ Occasionally, issues with improperly generated CSV |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

Comma-separated values:

```{csv}
response_id,date,respondent_id,question_number,response
1,2022-02-01,27,3,"B"
1,2022-02-01,27,4,"C"
```

First row is typically header; comma (or other delimiter) for each column; newline for each row.

Tab-separated values:

```{tsv}
response_id date  respondent_id question_number response
1 2022-02-01  27  3 "B"
1 2022-02-01  27  4 "C"
```

```{r}
# a random sampling of Allegheny County air quality data, downloaded from wprdc.org:
air_quality <- read_csv("data/air-quality2.csv")
air_quality
air_quality %>% 
  mutate(description_f=as_factor(description))

# important tweaks: header (none and/or supply your own); col_types; na

emissions <- read_tsv("data/sdg_13_10.tsv")
emissions
#read_delim("file.dat", delim="|")

#excel_sheets("file.xlsx") # list of sheets 
#read_excel()

#read_excel(sheets=c())

```

Other things you can configure in `{readr}` when importing data: provide your own header; skip lines; read a subset of lines; specify decimal marks; select only certain columns for import; read multiple files into a single table.

### Looking around

Here are some ways to superficially browse/examine a dataset:

```{r}
str(air_quality)  # examine structure of object

air_quality  # preview data
View(air_quality)
head(air_quality)  # fetch first 6 rows
tail(air_quality, n=20)  # fetch last 20 rows

air_quality %>% 
  slice_sample(n=20)  # extract ("slice") 20 random rows

# sorting!
# using the dplyr::arrange() function:
air_quality %>% 
  arrange(date)  # arrange by date, ascending
air_quality %>% 
  arrange(desc(date))  # descending (most recent first)
air_quality %>% 
  arrange(site, parameter)  # arrange first by site, then by parameter

# see a summary of each variable in an object
summary(air_quality)
```

### Other types of data

Here are packages you can check out for other types of data:

-   web APIs: `{httr}`
-   web scraping: `{rvest}`
-   google sheets: `{googlesheets4}`
-   SPSS, Stata, SAS files: `{haven}`
-   databases: `{DBI}`
-   json: `{jsonlite}`
-   XML: `{xml2}`
-   plain text: `readr::read_lines()`

## The Tidy Data concept

![Illustrations from the [Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/) blog [Tidy Data for reproducibility, efficiency, and collaboration](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2020/10/12/tidy-data/) by Julia Lowndes and Allison Horst](images/tidydata_1.jpg)

![Illustrations from the [Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/) blog [Tidy Data for reproducibility, efficiency, and collaboration](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2020/10/12/tidy-data/) by Julia Lowndes and Allison Horst](images/tidydata_2.jpg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Important syntax sidebar: the pipe, `%>%`

The **pipe** is typed as **`%>%`** or using the (Win) **Ctrl+Shift+M** or (macOS) **Cmd+Shift+M** keyboard shortcut. Provided by `{magrittr}` and used almost everywhere in the tidyverse.

What does it do? `expressionA %>% functionB()` passes the output of `expressionA` as an implicit first argument of `functionB()`:

```{r}
storms
names(storms)
storms %>% 
  select(c(name, year, wind))

# writing the above without a pipe
select(storms, c(name, year, wind))

# so what? compare once we start chaining (piping) multiple functions:

# sort by wind (descending) after selecting columns:
storms %>% 
  select(c(name, year, wind)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(wind))

# doing the same without the pipe:
arrange(select(storms, c(name, year, wind)), desc(wind))

# ^ increasingly illegible
# another alternative is to write shorter lines of code without nesting, but then you'll have a lot of intermediate objects in your environment.
```

### and what about `<-` for object assignment? Can I use `=` instead?

```{r}
area <- 16 * 4
area
area = 16 * 4
area
area <- 16 * 4
```

**Yes, but** `<-` is recommended, because:

1.  It is community convention, which is important when you read others' code
2.  Besides object assignment, `=` in R is also used with *named arguments*; it can be visually helpful to separate these different functionalities with different symbols, `<-` and `=` respectively.

Keyboard shortcuts to type **`<-`**: (Win) **Alt+-** or (macOS) **Option+-**

## Columns: renaming, splitting, creating

Using `{dplyr}` ([cheat sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-transformation.pdf)) and `{tidyr}` ([cheat sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/tidyr.pdf)).

```{r}
storms

storms %>% 
  select(name, year, wind) # retain only certain columns

storms %>% 
  relocate(status, .after=name) # move column

storms %>% 
  rename(type=status) # rename column, new_name=old_name

# separate or unite columns:
table3
table3 %>% 
  separate(col=rate, into=c("cases", "population"), sep="/", convert=TRUE)

table5
table5 %>% 
  unite(col="year", century, year, sep="")

# mutate (create a new column):
table3 %>% 
  separate(col=rate, 
           into=c("cases", "population"), 
           sep="/", 
           convert=TRUE) %>%
  mutate(per_capita=cases/population)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Missing values

Sometimes, missing values are no problem 👍

But sometimes, you might want to:

-   investigate which observations have missing values and verify them
-   drop (delete) incomplete observations
-   or, replace missing values with something else (e.g., `0`)

```{r}
storms
# drop the rows that have NA in the hurricane_force_diameter column:
storms %>% 
  drop_na(hurricane_force_diameter)

# replace NA with 0
na_diam <- storms %>% 
  filter(is.na(hurricane_force_diameter))
na_diam
na_diam %>% 
  replace_na(list(hurricane_force_diameter=0))

# functions often have to make assumptions about NA
# examine docs for these assumptions, and configurability
mean(storms$hurricane_force_diameter)  # returns NA
# why? (5 + 10 + NA)/3 = NA
?mean
mean(storms$hurricane_force_diameter, na.rm=TRUE) # returns 18.14766
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Match values; regular expressions

### Filter/subset by column contents

```{r}
# category 3 storm observations:
storms %>% 
  filter(category==3)
# name matching a vector of strings:
storms %>% 
  filter(name %in% c("Amy", "Andrew"))

```

![Artwork by \@allison_horst](images/dplyr_filter.jpg)

### Getting all distinct values in a column

```{r}

# distinct() gives unique values of a variable/column
# all storm names in the set:
storms %>% 
  select(name) %>% 
  distinct(name) %>% 
  arrange(name)
```

### Grouping and summarizing

```{r}
# count how many observations are associated with each storm name:
storms %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise(n())

# summarize wind values after grouping by name:
storms %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise(n(),
            min(wind),
            mean(wind),
            median(wind),
            max(wind),
            sd(wind))
```

### Use regular expressions (regex)

A widely used notation for precisely describing and matching patterns in text. Part of `{stringr}` ([cheat sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/strings.pdf)), which has very many tools for working with strings.

```{r}
storms %>% 
  filter(str_detect(name, "A.*"))  # get observations whose storm starts with A

# replace all instances of a string with a replacement:
storms %>% 
  mutate(name = str_replace_all(name, "AL011993", "MyStorm")) %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise(n())
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Reshape data (pivot)

When a dataset doesn't have one observation per row and/or one variable per column, we need to **reshape** it using `{tidyr}`.

In `table2`, one column shows `type` (of measurement), either "cases" or "population."

```{r}
View(table2)
```

We can use the information in `type` to make two new columns, `cases` and `population`, which hold the value of `count`. We do this with `pivot_wider()`:

```{r}
table2 %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=type, values_from=count)
```

In contrast, `table4a` has a column for each year; we would like to move year information into its own column, and reduce

```{r}
table4a

table4a %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=c(`1999`, `2000`), names_to="year", values_to="cases")
```

Working with our hairy emissions example:

```{r}
emissions2 <- emissions %>% 
  mutate(`1990`=as.double(`1990`), `1991`=as.double(`1991`),
         `1992`=as.double(`1992`), `1993`=as.double(`1993`),
         `1994`=as.double(`1994`), `1995`=as.double(`1995`),
         `1996`=as.double(`1996`), `1997`=as.double(`1997`),
         `1998`=as.double(`1998`), `1999`=as.double(`1999`),
         `2000`=as.double(`2000`), `2001`=as.double(`2001`),
         `2002`=as.double(`2002`), `2003`=as.double(`2003`),
         `2004`=as.double(`2004`), `2005`=as.double(`2005`),
         `2006`=as.double(`2006`), `2007`=as.double(`2007`),
         `2008`=as.double(`2008`), `2009`=as.double(`2009`),
         `2010`=as.double(`2010`), `2011`=as.double(`2011`),
         `2012`=as.double(`2012`), `2013`=as.double(`2013`),
         `2014`=as.double(`2014`), `2015`=as.double(`2015`),
         `2016`=as.double(`2016`), `2017`=as.double(`2017`),
         `2018`=as.double(`2018`), `2019`=as.double(`2019`),
         )
emissions
emissions2
emissions2 %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=c(`1990`,`1991`,`1992`,`1993`,`1994`,`1995`,`1996`,`1997`,`1998`,`1999`,`2000`,`2001`,`2002`,`2003`,`2004`,`2005`,`2006`,`2007`,`2008`,`2009`,`2010`,`2011`,`2012`,`2013`,`2014`,`2015`,`2016`,`2017`,`2018`,`2019`), names_to="year", values_to="index")

# what else needs to be done to get this dataset tidy?

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Save data

Using `{readr}`

```{r}
table3
table3 %>% 
  write_csv("table3.csv")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Where to go next

Here are some ways you can continue learning:

-   Wrangling topics:

    -   Learn about [factors](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html)! (`{base}`, `{forcats}`)
    -   Summarizing data (`{dplyr}`)
    -   Relational data (joins), binding rows/columns (`{dplyr}`)
    -   Learn more about regex, if that's useful to you
    -   Apply ad hoc functions to columns (`{purrr}`)
    -   Explore other data/file types

-   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), or R4DS, a free online book by Wickham and Grolemund

    -   Anecdotally, R4DS is the most popular resource I see recommended for starting in R
    -   [Dr. Wickham](https://hadley.nz/) (Chief Scientist, RStudio & adjunct prof. of stats at U of Auckland, Stanford, and Rice) is also creator/lead developer of the tidyverse

-   [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.technology.pitt.edu/services/ondemand-training-linkedin-learning), offered via Pitt IT, has video courses

-   [PittCat ebooks](https://pitt.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?query=any,contains,r%20statistics&tab=Everything&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&vid=01PITT_INST:01PITT_INST&lang=en&offset=0), access to thousands of online tech books

-   [exercism R track](https://exercism.org/tracks/r), a platform for learning to code

-   Or dive into packages and resources specific to your field (see [Big Book of R](https://www.bigbookofr.com/) for ideas)

-   Pitt students: STAT 1621 Principles of Data Science teaches R from scratch (using R4DS) as well as getting you into the basics of data science (i.e., using lots of statistics on big data)

-   We offer training for groups (labs, collaborations, etc.)

### Where to get answers; reference resources

Here are resources for solving specific questions/problems you have in R:

-   Weekly Open Office Hour: Mondays 5--6pm (see flier below)
-   Pitt ULS [AskUs](https://library.pitt.edu/ask-us): email responses for simple questions and/or book an appointment for in-person or Zoom help
-   [StackOverflow (questions tagged R)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) is a great place for tech questions (search before asking)

Reference resources and ways to connect with the R user community:

-   The [Big Book of R](https://www.bigbookofr.com/) is an annotated bibliography of R resources, especially (e-)books (many of them free).
